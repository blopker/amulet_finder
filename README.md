Amulet Finder
===

This script will generate various whitespace characters at the end of an amulet poem to try and find a 'rarer' version, an amulet with more eights in the SHA256.
See https://text.bargains/amulet/ for more information.

Instructions
---
Open the script and change the `amulet` variable to the poem you want to make rarer. You can also set the `rarity` variable to chose how many eights should be in the amulet hash.

To run:
```
python3 main.py
```
